This code is based on the conntextlonet code of Vadim Kantorov (https://github.com/vadimkantorov/contextlocnet)

## Pre-requisites

Please follow the steps of https://github.com/vadimkantorov/contextlocnet

## Pre-trained Models

You can find the pre-trained models here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QobgtcKX06QOY70Og3ezoRm_1Gns5112

## Test Model

```
th test.lua <pre-trained model>  <unique_id>
```

The above command will apply pre-trained model on all the MS COCO test images and gives the class scores for each proposal. You can use unique_id to specify the name of file which would be used to save the test scores.

## More code coming soon
